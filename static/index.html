                <p class="intro">A lot has happened since the last e-mail. KeyPublisher has been renamed to eZ Exceed, and we have now released version 1.0 of our editorial extension. The product is booming, and this is what we’ve been up to lately.</p>

                <h2>Launch and eZ Market</h2>
                <p>30th of May, Exceed went through eZ’s Quality Assurance, and was launched with its own page on eZ Market. A week after, we added our marketing video, a quick walkthrough of Exceed. Visit our eZ Market page for more information about Exceed, screenshots and videos.</p>

                <h2>iPad App</h2>
                <p>We have been very busy working on getting our two native Exceed apps ready for the App Store. The native iPad App features an easy overview of your sites and easy login. Our interface is designed ‘touch first’, so working on the iPad is as fast and easy as working from your laptop.</p>

                <h2>iPhone App</h2>
                <p>We’ve also been working our mobile iPhone app. Since mobile is a bit different, this app will not use the same interface as the desktop and iPad – it has an experience tailored just for mobile. The app will let you edit bits of content, post messages on content, receive push notifications, edit your user and upload media from your phone.</p>

                <h2>Semi direct manipulation</h2>
                <p>We’re firm believers that editing content should be easy, really easy. Direct Manipulation means drag and drop, in-place editing and real WYSIWYG. But doing direct manipulation in a highly flexible system is hard, nobody has solved this problem. We’re starting up, it is now possible to do semi-direct manipulation on text in Exceed. This means easy click to edit and publish – great for doing minor corrections or adjustments.</p>
